# Puppeteer: Examples

This is the official set of Puppeteer examples. For a list of curated examples and use-cases,
including third-party ones, see [pptr.dev/examples](https://pptr.dev/examples).

## Run

Check out this repository and and install the package dependencies, using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

To build a version of Puppeteer to be used with the examples, run the following command:

npm run build
```

After both commands have succeeded, run an individual example using the following command:

NODE_PATH=../ node examples/search.js
